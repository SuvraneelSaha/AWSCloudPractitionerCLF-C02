IAM - Identity Access Management 
```

~~~
• IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
• Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
• Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
• Groups only contain users, not other groups
• Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups
~~~

~~~
IAM: Permissions
• Users or Groups can be
assigned JSON documents
called policies
• These policies define the
permissions of the users
• In AWS you apply the least
privilege principle: don’t give
more permissions than a user
needs 
~~~

IAM is a global service
