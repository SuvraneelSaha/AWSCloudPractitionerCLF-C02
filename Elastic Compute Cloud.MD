AWS Budget Setup 
~~~

~~~
when setting up a budget we need to keep in consideration 
1. Free tier usage 
2. No of Services running 
3. Budget of whatever amount you have set the limit for 

The budget and billing can be done either from the Root or from IAM users with adminstrative permissions 
only if the root has changed the IAM users to access the billing issues via. 
Also you will get emails when the usage surpasses the usage

Iam users and role access to billing information

Bills give the detailed structured breakdown on how the charges are being done
